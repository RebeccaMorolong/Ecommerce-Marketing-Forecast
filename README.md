# 📊 E-Commerce Marketing Forecast
Focus Question:
“Why is high website traffic not translating into increased sales, and how can we improve conversion?”

# ✅ Executive Summary
Despite consistently high website traffic, sales growth has stagnated. Using a Gradient Boosting model trained on behavioral and marketing data, we uncovered that conversion bottlenecks—particularly low engagement and stock limitations—are undermining performance.
Our model achieves a strong predictive performance (R² = 0.9988), indicating a high level of trust in the findings. Key drivers of sales were identified, and several actionable strategies are recommended to unlock latent value.

# 🔬 Model Performance
- Model: Gradient Boosting Regressor
- R²: 0.9988
- MSE: 19.32
- Top Features: Engagement Rate > Product Availability > Website Traffic > Customer Behavior

# 📈 Scenario Simulation
We modeled a 20% increase in engagement rate under current traffic conditions.
- Projected Sales Lift: ~17%
- Interpretation: Engagement-driven campaigns could disproportionately boost conversion.
We also simulated improved inventory during a traffic spike:
- Result: Conversion increased significantly—suggesting stock-outs are a major sales blocker.

# 🛠️ Recommendations
* | Area | Action | Priority |
 
* | Conversion UX | A/B test CTAs, improve landing page clarity, reduce load time | High |
 
* | Stock Strategy | Align product availability with peak traffic periods | High |
 
* | Engagement Campaigns | Use email/personalization strategies to boost session quality | Medium |
  
* | Data Infrastructure | Start logging funnel stages (cart adds, dropouts) for deeper diagnostics | Medium | 



# 📦 Next Steps
- Integrate predictions into Power BI dashboards for scenario planning
- Design targeted marketing experiments using model-guided variables
- Collaborate with product and inventory teams to align supply with demand
- Optionally: move toward time-series forecasting using historical trends + planned campaigns
